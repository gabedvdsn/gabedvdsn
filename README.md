#### ðŸ”­ What I'm up to
**School:** I am currently working with a team of 3 others to develop a 2D dungeon crawner called **Banish The Light**. Our goal is to create a very immersive, intense, yet thoughtful game to compete in the IEEE game awards competition later this year.
**Other:** I am also currently working on a modular, composition-centric [Gameplay Ability System Framework](https://github.com/gabedvdsn/FESGAS/tree/main) using UniTask to create light-weight ability behavior runtimes (based on Unreal Engine's built-in GAS).

#### What I've Been Up To

**School:** I just wrapped up my university capstone project: a 2.5D dungeon crawler called **Realms of Chaos**!
**Other:** I just wrapped up development of a [State System Framework](https://github.com/gabedvdsn/FESStateSystem)!
