My name is Gabriel Davidson. I'm a Unity game developer with a passion for gameplay scripting!

### ðŸ”­ What I'm up to
##### Banish the Light
I am currently working with a team of 3 others to develop a 2D dungeon crawler called **Banish The Light**, inspired by similar titles such as Enter the Gungeon and Binding of Isaac. Our game was entered into the 2025 IEE GameSig competition, where we earned a semi-finalist position. We plan on developing more content for the project and releasing it on Steam by the end of the year.

I played a few roles in the development process, most notably being designing a procedural generation algorithm and updating our codebase with a modular workflow, especially with respect to enemy behavior and attack patterns. These developments have allowed us to seamlessly add more procedural content without having to extend our underlying framework.

##### FESGAS
I am currently working on a [Gameplay Ability System Framework](https://github.com/gabedvdsn/FESGAS/tree/main) using UniTask to create light-weight ability behavior runtimes (based on Unreal Engine's built-in GAS). In Fall, 2024, while I was working on my individual capstone project for University, I was interested in using a GAS framework, but I found that existing solutions didn' fit my needs. I am excited to have produced (and am continuing to work on) a highly extensible GAS framework with a focus on modularity and performance.

##### FES State System
In addition to the GAS framework I have been developing, I had previously produced a [State System Framework]([url](https://github.com/gabedvdsn/FESStateSystem)), which circumvents the long-standing issue of generic state systems by using a scriptable object-based approach. As opposed to a typical state system implementation, this framework allows for actors to exist in a number of states at once.
